# Forecasting 20/20

Predicting and forecasting ETF performance with machine learning

## Process

We tested and compared various machine learning algorithims, reliability, and ease of use.

Our first attempt used a Linear Regression model and we were not impressed with it's ability to forecast accurately. 

We decided to simplify our project by eliminating all models that didn't meet the following criteria:

1. The algorithim was relatively simple to use.
2. Results had a margin of error of 1 percent or less. 
3. The models were conducive for time series prediction.
