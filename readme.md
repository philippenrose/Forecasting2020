# Forecasting 20/20

## Purpose:
Predicting and forecasting ETF performance with machine learning.

## Process:

We tested and compared various machine learning algorithims, reliability, and ease of use.

Our first attempt used a Linear Regression model and we were not impressed with it's ability to forecast accurately. 

We decided to simplify our project by eliminating all models that didn't meet the following criteria:

1. The algorithim was relatively simple to use.
2. Results had a margin of error of 1 percent or less. 
3. The models were conducive for time series prediction.

### This left us with the following models:

- [**FB Prophet**](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)
- [**LSTM Recurrent Nerual Network**](https://pythonprogramming.net/rnn-tensorflow-python-machine-learning-tutorial/)
